Callr is a new technology that makes calling to conference calls absolutely painless. In fact, you don't have to call in anymore - it calls you. You never have to remember a conference number/passcode again. It securely syncs with Google or Outlook calendars and either calls (or texts) you when you have a conference call and automatically patches you in. It also works for regular calls. No more searching your calendar/email for phone numbers.

### Why Callr?

Callr solves the real pain of calling to scheduled calls by using an intelligent algorithm that understands your event. Callr is not a replacement to your conference calling service, rather, it's the smart secretary that connects you to all of your calls without you doing anything.
