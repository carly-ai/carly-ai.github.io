When we launched Carly.ai on October 2, 2014, we had no idea that enthusiastic word-of-mouth would propel us to the 125,000 minute milestone so quickly.

We are proud to share that on March 1, 2015, we connected our 125,000th minute of calls. Words cannot express how grateful we are for your support, so a big and heartfelt thank you will have to do!

As some of you know, Carly.ai was created after we missed yet another important client call because we were heads-down working instead of staring at our calendar. We quickly learned that you felt the same frustration, and we have yet to meet someone who enjoys digging through emails and calendars to find the right dial-in information and its companion, the complicated PIN number.

We knew there had to be a better way, so we created it.

During testing, we kept getting the same reaction, “Your system calls me at the time of my conference call? This is brilliant!”

Thanks!
